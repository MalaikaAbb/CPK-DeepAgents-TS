/**
 * Agents backing the Interrupt-based route.
 *
 * https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/generative-ui/your-components/interrupt-based
 * (TypeScript tab)
 *
 * Two agents, one per section of the page:
 *
 * - `agent` — the Implementation walkthrough. `agentNameMiddleware.beforeModel`
 *   calls `interrupt` once, with a plain string, until the state carries a name.
 * - `multiAgent` — the "Condition UI executions" section. Two interrupts in one
 *   hook, each carrying a `type` the frontend's `useInterrupt({ enabled })`
 *   predicates dispatch on.
 *
 * Both middlewares are the page's TypeScript verbatim, and the page now prints
 * the `createDeepAgent(...)` call that consumes the first one, so only
 * `multiAgent` is still written to the shape the page describes rather than
 * copied from it.
 *
 * Note the TypeScript tab is the cleaner of the two languages here: the Python
 * tab needs an `AgentMiddleware` subclass with an explicit `state_schema`,
 * while `createMiddleware` carries the schema and the hook together.
 *
 * The page's "Make your agent aware of interruptions" section does not work at
 * @copilotkit/sdk-js 1.66.2, and it is reproduced here rather than corrected so
 * the route shows what the page currently teaches. Measured, with a fake model
 * capturing the request the model would have received:
 *
 *   `exposeState` is applied in the CopilotKit middleware's own
 *   `wrapModelCall`, reading `request.state`. That object is scoped to the
 *   *declaring* middleware's `stateSchema`, so the CopilotKit middleware —
 *   which declares `copilotKitStateSchema` — sees `messages` and `copilotkit`
 *   and nothing else. `agentName` is declared on `agentNameMiddleware`, a
 *   different middleware, so it is invisible and no state note is built. A
 *   probe middleware declaring `agentName` itself reads it fine at the same
 *   point, which is what pins the cause to schema scoping rather than ordering:
 *   the system prompt is unchanged with the middleware first, last, and with
 *   `exposeState: true`.
 *
 * So the run resumes with the name in thread state and the frontend renders it,
 * but the model is not told what it is. `sharedState.ts` hit the same wall from
 * the other direction and carries the same note.
