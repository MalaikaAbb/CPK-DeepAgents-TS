/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 3 of 3
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * One entry per doc page, in the order the doc nav lists them.
 *
 * Entries are deliberately short. `docUrl`, `demoUrl` and the output filename
 * are derived from `project.config.ts` plus the fields below, so no entry can
 * point at the wrong framework's docs and filenames stay in nav order without
 * anyone numbering them by hand.
 *
 * ── This repo's slice of the nav ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every page here was read in its **TypeScript** tab; the Python tabs are the
 * sibling repo's job. Two tracked doc pages are missing on purpose:
 * `shared-state/state-inputs-outputs` and `shared-state/workflow-execution`.
 * Both are reference-only routes in `frontend/src/lib/nav-config.ts` — the
 * first is a Python-only page whose output schema the JS dev server ignores,
 * the second is an upstream duplicate of it — so neither owns a `/demo-chat`
 * surface and there is nothing for the recorder to drive. That is a gap in the
 * coverage, not an oversight: see PROJECT_GOAL.md, "Gaps the pipeline misses".
 *
 * ── The line ranges ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights. They are
 * hardcoded, which means they drift the moment someone edits a demo page.
 * Doctor guards this: where a file carries `[!code highlight]` or `#region`
 * markers, it checks the range still covers one and names the marker's current
 * line when it does not. Keep those markers in the frontend and the guard keeps
 * working.
 *
 * ── `knownIssue` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three of the pages below are on the QA report as broken, and their clips
 * exist to show that: Reading agent state, Writing agent state, and the
 * prebuilt tab of Predictive State Updates. The Python sibling files all three
 * identically — this repo had been recording the first and third as `[PASS]`
 * because nothing in their takes asserted the panel that stays empty.
 * `knownIssue` is what makes the run say `[ISSUE]` rather than `[PASS]`, and it
 * is the same object `ci/build-report.mjs` renders into the daily report — so
 * the sentence typed into Notepad on video and the row that goes to the manager
 * are one string, written here, once.
 *
 * A page whose defect gets fixed upstream should have its `knownIssue` deleted
 * in the same change that confirms the fix. Leaving a stale one behind is worse
 * than having none: the clip keeps asserting a bug that is gone.
