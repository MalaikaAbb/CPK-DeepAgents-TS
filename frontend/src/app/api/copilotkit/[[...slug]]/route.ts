/**
 * The Copilot Runtime, as the Quickstart now builds it.
 *
 * Three things moved when the docs switched to the v2 runtime surface, and all
 * three are load-bearing:
 *
 *   - The import is `@copilotkit/runtime/v2`, not `@copilotkit/runtime`. There
 *     is no `serviceAdapter` on this surface at all — `ExperimentalEmptyAdapter`
 *     belonged to the v1 GraphQL runtime and has no counterpart here.
 *   - `createCopilotRuntimeHandler` returns a plain fetch handler rather than a
 *     `{ handleRequest }` wrapper, so the route is just the verb exports below.
 *   - The file lives at `[[...slug]]/route.ts`, not `route.ts`. The handler
 *     serves a subtree — `/info`, agent runs, thread list/rename/delete — so a
 *     single-segment route would 404 everything except the bare URL.
 *
 * The agent map is unchanged from before: the Quickstart registers one
 * `LangGraphAgent`, and this harness registers one per graph in
 * `backend/langgraph.json` with the same constructor arguments.
 */
/**
 * Graphs that get AG-UI's **structured** interrupt outcome rather than the
 * legacy `on_interrupt` custom event.
 *
 * `@ag-ui/langgraph` still defaults to the legacy channel
 * (`emitInterruptOutcome: false`, `enableLegacyOnInterruptEvent: true`) for
 * clients that resume through `forwardedProps.command.resume`. Two things
 * follow from that default, both of them visible on the Interrupt-based route:
 *
 *   - the interrupt value is JSON-stringified on the way out, so an object
 *     payload reaches `useInterrupt` as a string and `event.value.content` is
 *     `undefined`;
 *   - `cancel()` has nothing to address and only dismisses locally, which the
 *     Governed Actions page's `deny` path needs.
 *
 * Opting in turns both around: `interrupt` / `interrupts` carry real
 * `Interrupt` objects (the original value under
 * `metadata.langgraph.raw`), and `resolve`/`cancel` resume through
 * `RunAgentInput.resume[]`, which `@copilotkit/react-core` 1.71 speaks. Set
 * per graph rather than globally so the single-interrupt agent keeps the wire
 * shape the doc page's snippet is written against.
