 * Steps 3 and 4 of the doc are implemented here. Steps 1, 2 and 5 are not, and
 * cannot be: they start at `npx copilotkit@latest login` and a
 * `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` from a hosted Intelligence project, which is an
 * account-scoped resource this harness does not have.
 *
 * The route used to be a bare header for that reason. It stopped being one when
 * the 2026-09-09 sync rewrote steps 3 and 4 from the multi-route handler to the
 * single-route one — that half needs no hosted project, so it is now the half
 * under test.

          The single-route runtime transport. Until the 2026-09-09 sync this
          page mounted the multi-route handler at{" "}
          <code>app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts</code> and exported four
          verbs. It now mounts <code>mode: &quot;single-route&quot;</code> at a
          plain <code>route.ts</code>, exports only <code>POST</code>, and pairs
          it with <code>useSingleEndpoint</code> on the provider.

          That is a second runtime mount in this repo, not a rewrite of
          an existing one. <code>/api/copilotkit</code> stays multi-route
          because{" "}
          <a
            href="/quickstart"
            className="text-[var(--accent)] underline underline-offset-4"

          still publishes <code>[[...slug]]</code>, <code>GET</code> +{" "}
          <code>POST</code>, and <code>useSingleEndpoint=&#123;false&#125;</code>.
          It is also the only mount that can serve this repo&apos;s thread
          routes, which multi-route mode alone dispatches. The new mount takes
          the same runtime object, so the only variable between them is the
          transport.

        The step is introduced with &quot;It carries chat, thread, memory, and
        annotation requests through one <code>POST</code> endpoint.&quot; Only
        the first of those four is true at <code>@copilotkit/runtime</code>{" "}
        1.69.2. <code>validateMethod</code> in{" "}
        <code>v2/runtime/endpoints/single-route-helpers</code> accepts exactly
        seven envelope methods — <code>agent/run</code>,{" "}
        <code>agent/suggest</code>, <code>agent/connect</code>,{" "}
        <code>agent/stop</code>, <code>info</code>,{" "}
        <code>inspector/metadata</code>, <code>transcribe</code> — and answers{" "}
        <code>400 Unsupported method</code> for anything else. The multi-route
        router matches twenty, including all eight <code>threads/*</code>, all
        four <code>memories/*</code>, and <code>annotate</code>. None of those
        thirteen is reachable through the single endpoint. Use the probe button
        on the demo to see it per request class.

        Separately from the method allowlist,{" "}
        <code>createCopilotRuntimeHandler</code> dispatches single-route
        requests with <code>threadEndpointsEnabled: false</code>, where
        multi-route passes <code>true</code>. That flag feeds{" "}
        <code>resolveThreadEndpointInfo</code>, so a single-route{" "}
        <code>/info</code> reports no REST thread endpoints and no managed
        thread metadata even when the runtime is a full Intelligence runtime.
        The client believes it, and stops asking. So the doc&apos;s closing step
        — open Inspector, find your thread under <strong>Threads</strong> —
        cannot pass on the transport the same page just told you to adopt.

        The coding-agent prompt at the top of the page is unchanged, and still
        instructs the agent to &quot;enable the multi-route Runtime, align the
        frontend transport, and expose the full Runtime subtree for GET, POST,
        PATCH, and DELETE.&quot; The manual steps immediately below now say
        single-route, one verb. Whichever half a reader follows, the other half
        of the same page describes a different app.

        Not a defect, but worth knowing before comparing this route against the
        others: the client only uses the stateless{" "}
        <code>/agent/:id/suggest</code> endpoint on non-<code>single</code>{" "}
        transports, because that URL is multi-route. Under{" "}
