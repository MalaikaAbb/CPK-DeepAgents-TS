          Showing the user what the agent is doing before it has finished doing
          it. Graph state only reaches the frontend at node boundaries, and a
          single node can run for many seconds — predictive state updates push a
          running approximation out in the meantime.

          The page splits three ways and <strong>all three are live here</strong>
          , behind the toggle at the top of the demo. That is the sharpest
          difference between this repo and its Python sibling: the TypeScript
          tabs print both custom graphs in full — annotation, node, wiring,{" "}
          <code>compile</code> — while the Python tabs show a bare node with no
          graph around it, so the Python repo can only quote them.

          <code>stateStreamingMiddleware</code> takes <code>stateItem</code>{" "}
          mappings from a tool argument to a state key. Nothing calls an emit
          function: the middleware parses the model&apos;s partial tool-call
          arguments as they stream and writes each completed element into state.

          The page writes the tool body as{" "}

          to give the model an argument shape to fill in. That is the one line
          that has to change: a streamed value is a <em>prediction</em> scoped
          to the run, and a tool returning its arguments contributes no{" "}
          <code>observed_steps</code> — so the node&apos;s own update wipes the
          list the instant the stream ends. Measured: the panel filled during
          generation and was blank again by the time the reply finished. The
          tool here returns a <code>Command</code> instead, which is the same
          correction both custom-graph variants below already carry.

              This variant is a real Deep Agent, so it has the filesystem and
              planning tools that come with one. Ask it to &ldquo;execute a
              website launch checklist&rdquo; and it will spend the run
              globbing for files that do not exist and report each failed
              search as a step. An abstract multi-step task keeps the demo on
              the mechanism.
