          UI outside the chat that tracks the agent while it is still working. A
          Deep Agent&apos;s state normally only reaches the frontend when a node
          finishes; <code>copilotkitEmitState</code> pushes it mid-node, so a
          three-second task shows three steps completing rather than one long
          spinner.

          The page prints <code>searchesStateMiddleware</code> and a{" "}
          <code>chatNode</code> and stops. The middleware is complete — unlike
          the Python tab, it carries its own state schema — but nothing calls
          the node, and the prose says only that the loop belongs &ldquo;inside a
          custom graph node function that has access to state and config&rdquo;.
          A prebuilt Deep Agent has no nodes you write, so:

          <strong>The emit loop needs a caller.</strong> A <code>tool()</code> is
          the one place in a prebuilt Deep Agent that is handed a{" "}
          <code>RunnableConfig</code>, and <code>copilotkitEmitState</code> needs
          one. So a <code>research</code> tool calls it, which is the Python
          tab&apos;s own first suggestion made concrete.

        <p>
          <code>copilotkitEmitState</code> streams a value to the frontend; it
          does not write it into the graph. When the node returns, whatever it
          returns becomes the state, and anything only emitted is lost — the
          rows would appear and then vanish. The Predictive State Updates page
          says this outright; this page does not, even though its example has
          the same problem. The <code>research</code> tool therefore returns a{" "}
          <code>Command({"{ update }"})</code> carrying the final list.
