        <p>
          The Quickstart used to build a v1 <code>CopilotRuntime</code> with an{" "}
          <code>ExperimentalEmptyAdapter</code> at{" "}
          <code>app/api/copilotkit/route.ts</code>. It now builds a v2 one, and
          all three differences break silently if you miss them:
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>1. The import is <code>@copilotkit/runtime/v2</code>.</strong>{" "}
          There is no <code>serviceAdapter</code> on this surface at all —{" "}
          <code>ExperimentalEmptyAdapter</code> has no counterpart.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>
            2. The file is <code>[[...slug]]/route.ts</code>.
          </strong>{" "}
          <code>createCopilotRuntimeHandler</code> serves a whole subtree —{" "}
          <code>/info</code>, agent runs, thread list, rename, delete — so a
          single-segment <code>route.ts</code> 404s everything except the bare
          URL. Four verbs are exported, not one: PATCH and DELETE are how
          threads are renamed and removed.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>
            3. The provider needs <code>useSingleEndpoint={"{false}"}</code>.
          </strong>{" "}
          Omit it and the client posts the bare URL against a multi-route
          handler — every run 404s while <code>/info</code> still answers 200,
          so the app looks connected and does nothing.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="What the 2026-11 sync changed here">
        <p>
          <strong>Provider.</strong> Step 6 now wraps the app in{" "}
          <code>
            &lt;CopilotKitProvider runtimeUrl=&quot;/api/copilotkit&quot;
            agentId=&quot;sample_agent&quot; useSingleEndpoint={"{false}"}&gt;
          </code>{" "}
          instead of <code>&lt;CopilotKit agent=&quot;sample_agent&quot;&gt;</code>.
          This harness keeps <code>&lt;CopilotKit&gt;</code> at the root: the bare
          provider does not mount <code>CopilotListeners</code>, which the
          Predictive State Updates route depends on (README §9 items 5 and 11b).
          Nothing on this route needs the listener, and the page does not
          mention the trade-off.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Model.</strong> The agent now prints{" "}
          <code>model: &quot;openai:gpt-6-luna&quot;</code>. <code>backend/agent.ts</code>{" "}
          still reads <code>OPENAI_MODEL</code> (default <code>gpt-4o</code>);
          set it to <code>gpt-6-luna</code> to run the page&apos;s literal.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Install + key.</strong> The install line dropped{" "}
          <code>@copilotkit/react-ui</code> and added{" "}
          <code>@ag-ui/client@1.0.2</code>, which only the FastAPI runtime tab
          imports — not this repo&apos;s Deep Agent tab, so the pin is not applied.
          The project key now comes from{" "}
          <code>npx copilotkit@latest project select</code>, written to{" "}
          <code>.env</code> rather than <code>.env.local</code>; step 1 is now
          &ldquo;sign in to cloud-hosted Intelligence&rdquo;, which does not
          issue <code>COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_TOKEN</code>. The runtime route
          step&apos;s <code>[[...slug]]</code> path and PATCH/DELETE exports now
          match what this repo already mounted.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="info" title="What the 2026-09-04 sync changed here">
        The Quickstart&apos;s <code>.env.local</code> block renamed{" "}
        <code>INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY</code> to{" "}
        <code>CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY</code>, changed the placeholder from{" "}
        <code>your_license_key</code> to <code>cpk-...</code>, and stopped
        calling it a license key — it is the project API key now. That last
        change is the useful one: the old placeholder actively encouraged the
        confusion the callout below exists to undo. Both the TypeScript and the
        FastAPI runtime tab changed the same way, and the callout&apos;s link
        moved from <code>/deepagents/premium/connect-your-runtime</code> to{" "}
        <code>/deepagents/intelligence/connect-your-runtime</code>. Nothing says
        whether the old variable still works, so this repo reads the new name
        first and falls back to the old one.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="info" title="Two credentials, not one">
        <p>
          <code>CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY</code> authorizes the runtime against the
          platform: it is what makes <code>/info</code> report{" "}
          <code>mode: &quot;intelligence&quot;</code> and what makes the thread
          endpoints return real rows. Leave it unset and the runtime falls back
          to SSE with an <code>InMemoryAgentRunner</code> — chat still works on
          every route here, but nothing persists across a restart.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <code>COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_TOKEN</code> is separate, and it is what the{" "}
          <em>client</em> gates features on. <code>/info</code> reports{" "}
          <code>licenseStatus</code> from it, and{" "}
          <code>&lt;CopilotThreadsDrawer&gt;</code> renders its locked
          &ldquo;Upgrade&rdquo; view unless that status is <code>valid</code> or{" "}
          <code>expiring</code> — regardless of whether threads actually work.
          So a runtime can serve threads perfectly while every drawer shows a
          lock. The panel above reports both axes separately for that reason.

      <Callout tone="info" title="identifyUser makes threads per-user">

          Without it every visitor shares one history. The runtime reads{" "}
