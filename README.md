## 2. Overview

Deep Agents is LangChain's framework for long-horizon agents — `createDeepAgent` returns a compiled LangGraph graph with planning and virtual-filesystem tools already installed. CopilotKit connects one of those graphs to a React app over the AG-UI protocol, so the agent can render components, call browser-side tools, suspend for human input, and share state with your UI.

This repo implements every Deep Agents doc page in that list as a live route, built from each page's **TypeScript** tab. It is a QA tool, not a tutorial: each route shows what the page teaches actually running, alongside the repo's own source read off disk at render time, plus a plain statement of anywhere the page and the shipped packages disagree. Eleven doc pages, nine routes (three doc URLs are query-string variants of one page), **eleven graphs** — eight Deep Agents plus three hand-built `StateGraph`s. The four A2UI pages are deliberately out of scope for this repo.

There is a Python sibling repo covering the same pages from the Python tabs. Where the two languages genuinely diverge — and they do, in four places that matter — each route says so and the difference is recorded in [§9](#9-known-issues--docvsimplementation-discrepancies).

**Backend language: TypeScript/Node.** The Quickstart's TypeScript tab describes a `langgraph.json` manifest served by the LangGraph CLI, and a callout on that tab tells you to pick the **Deep Agent** runtime tab (not FastAPI). That is what this repo builds.

**Why port 8124.** The Quickstart says 8123 and so does the Python sibling. Both repos publish identical graph ids (`sample_agent`, `tool_rendering_agent`, …), so on a shared port whichever server bound first would silently answer for the other language — a nasty way to lose an afternoon. Everything else about the URL is the page's.

One runtime endpoint, `/api/copilotkit`, serving all eleven graphs — the Quickstart's snippet widened from a single `LangGraphAgent` to one per graph id.

---

## 4. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version used | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 24.16.0 (20+ per the Quickstart) | |
| npm | 12.0.1 | or pnpm/yarn/bun |
| OpenAI API key | — | **Required.** Every agent uses it. |
| LangSmith / LangGraph Platform key | — | **Not** required locally. Only for a Platform deployment. |

No Python and no global CLI: `@langchain/langgraph-cli` is a dev dependency of `backend/`.

---

## 5. Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone <this-repo> deepagents-ts && cd deepagents-ts

# 2. Backend deps
cd backend && npm install && cd ..

# 3. Frontend deps
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

> **`npm install` in `backend/` will fail if you follow the doc's dependency list literally.** See [§9 item 1](#9-known-issues--docvsimplementation-discrepancies) — `deepagents` wants zod v4 and `@copilotkit/sdk-js` peer-requires v3. This repo's `package.json` already pins the combination that resolves; just run `npm install`.

**4. Environment.** There are two processes, so two files:

```bash
cp .env.example backend/.env        # then keep the backend block
cp .env.example frontend/.env.local # then keep the frontend block
```

| Variable | Goes in | Required | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `backend/.env` | **yes** | The model key. Every agent reads it. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `backend/.env` | no | Model id for every agent. Defaults to `gpt-4o`. |
| `LANGGRAPH_DEPLOYMENT_URL` | `frontend/.env.local` | no | Where the runtime route forwards runs. Defaults to `http://localhost:8124`. |
| `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` | `frontend/.env.local` | no | Sent as `langsmithApiKey`. Ignored by a local dev server. |
| `COPILOTKIT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | `frontend/.env.local` | no | Silences the runtime's telemetry notice. |

**Ports:** frontend `3000`, agent server `8124`. Change the agent port and you must change `LANGGRAPH_DEPLOYMENT_URL` to match.

---

## 6. Running the project

Two terminals — the CLI does not start both.

**Terminal 1 — the agent server:**

```bash
cd backend && npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev --port 8124 --no-browser
```

Success looks like this:

```
          Welcome to
╦  ┌─┐┌┐┌┌─┐╔═╗┬─┐┌─┐┌─┐┬ ┬
║  ├─┤││││ ┬║ ╦├┬┘├─┤├─┘├─┤
╩═╝┴ ┴┘└┘└─┘╚═╝┴└─┴ ┴┴  ┴ ┴

- 🚀 API: http://localhost:8124
- 🎨 Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://localhost:8124
```

Confirm with `curl http://localhost:8124/ok` → `{"ok":true}`, and that all eleven graphs registered:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8124/assistants/search \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"limit":50}' | jq -r '.[].graph_id' | sort
```

**Terminal 2 — the app:**

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

You should see `✓ Ready in …` and `- Local: http://localhost:3000`.

**Open <http://localhost:3000>.** Start at `/quickstart` — if that streams a reply, every other route's plumbing is fine.

---

## 7. What to expect — walkthrough per section

Every route has a notes page (source, discrepancies, a **Try it** box) and, where there is something to drive, a chrome-free demo at `<route>/demo-chat`.

### Getting Started

**`/`** — Introduction. Orientation and the live graph roster. Nothing to drive.

**`/quickstart`** → `sample_agent`
Proves the whole stack in one message: a Deep Agent with a single `tool()` call, published by the LangGraph server, reached through `CopilotRuntime`, driven by a `CopilotSidebar`.
*Try:* `What's the weather in Lisbon?`
*Pass:* tokens stream a word at a time; a collapsed `Called get_weather` row appears; the reply says Lisbon is sunny.
*Fail:* an error banner or no reply — the agent server is down, or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing from `backend/.env`.

### Generative UI

**`/generative-ui/tool-rendering`** → `tool_rendering_agent`
`useRenderTool` claims a backend tool by name and replaces its chat bubble; `useDefaultRenderTool` catches the rest.
*Try:* `What's the weather in Tokyo?` then `Write a short plan for a two-day trip to Tokyo`
*Pass:* the first draws a grey `Called the weather API for Tokyo.` line; the second makes the agent use its own planning tools, which fall through to the catch-all as `✓ write_todos` rows.
*Fail:* a default tool bubble instead of the grey line — the name in `useRenderTool` no longer matches the backend `tool()`.

**`/generative-ui/state-rendering`** → `state_rendering_agent`
`copilotkitEmitState` pushes state mid-node so a slow task reports progress; `useAgent` renders it outside the chat.
*Try:* `Research the best coffee shops in Tokyo`
*Pass:* a handful of task rows appear while the answer is still streaming, all ⏳, then flip to ✅ on the agent's closing `report_research_progress` call, and stay after the reply.
*Fail:* rows that appear then vanish — the emitted state was never returned by the node. Rows that never reach ✅ mean the closing call was skipped; that is what `gpt-4o` does here, and why this one agent pins the page's own `gpt-5.4`.

**`/generative-ui/your-components/interrupt-based`** → `interrupt_agent`, `interrupt_multi_agent` ⚠️
LangGraph `interrupt()` in a `createMiddleware` `beforeModel` hook, answered by `useInterrupt`. Two tabs: one interrupt, and two dispatched by `type` via `enabled`. Both are the page's code **as printed** — the second one does not work, and demonstrating that is the point.
*Try:* send `Hello`, then answer the form that appears.
*Pass:* on **One interrupt**, the first message is answered with a name form rather than a reply; submit a name and the run resumes using it. That half of the page is correct. Note that the reply only exists *because* the form was answered — a recorder or test that types and then waits for an assistant message will hang here, because the graph is parked, not broken.
*Expected failure:* on **Two, dispatched by type**, no card appears at all — the `enabled` predicates throw on `eventValue`, so neither handler claims the event.
*Real failure:* the *first* tab not working — check the agent server is up.

### App Control

**`/frontend-tools`** → `frontend_tools_agent`
A tool whose body runs in the browser. The backend defines no tool at all.
*Try:* `Say hello to Ada`
*Pass:* a browser `alert()` reading `Hello, Ada!`; dismiss it and a green line appears in the left panel; the agent then reports it said hello.
*Fail:* the agent describing what it *would* do — check `copilotkitMiddleware` is in the middleware array.

### Shared State

**`/shared-state/in-app-agent-read`** → `shared_state_agent`
Reading agent state as ordinary reactive React state.
*Try:* `Switch to Spanish`, then `What can you help me with?`
*Pass:* the panel starts at `Language: english`; the first turn flips it to `spanish` as the state delta lands, and the second reply arrives in Spanish. The JSON pane shows the agent's own fields — the message transcript is filtered out of it, or `language` would be thousands of lines down.
*Fail:* a dump with everything except `language` — the field lost its `zodState` wrapper. A panel that never moves means `set_language` was not called; see [§9 item 13](#9-known-issues--docvsimplementation-discrepancies).

**`/shared-state/in-app-agent-write`** → `shared_state_agent` ⚠️
`agent.setState` from the app, plus `agent.runAgent` to re-run immediately.
*Try:* `Tell me a fun fact about octopuses`, hit **Toggle Language**, ask again.
*Pass:* the panel and JSON dump flip to `spanish` and the value survives the round trip — the write works.
*Known limit:* **the reply stays in English.** The model never sees the value, and `exposeState` cannot reach it. Measured; see [§9 item 2](#9-known-issues--docvsimplementation-discrepancies).

**`/shared-state/predictive-state-updates`** → `predictive_state_agent`, `predictive_manual_graph`, `predictive_tool_graph`
**All three of the page's variants are live here**, behind a toggle — the sharpest advantage this repo has over the Python sibling, whose tabs only sketch the custom graphs.
*Try:* `Plan a 4-step process for onboarding a new customer, reporting each step as you go.` on each tab. Keep the task away from anything file-shaped — the prebuilt variant is a Deep Agent and will go hunting for real files if the wording invites it.
*Pass:* **Prebuilt** — step rows appear one at a time *before* the chat message completes. **Custom · manual** — exactly four fixed rows, one per second, then an ordinary answer (verified: four distinct states in order). **Custom · tool** — steps stream as the model writes the tool call, then a `ToolNode` runs it and the graph loops back.
*Fail:* nothing at all — the provider is `<CopilotKitProvider>` rather than `<CopilotKit>`; see [§9 item 5](#9-known-issues--docvsimplementation-discrepancies).

**`/shared-state/state-inputs-outputs`** — 📄 reference only, no demo.
A hand-built `StateGraph` with `input` / `output` schemas: `question` in and not back, `answer` back, `resources` never on the wire. The graph is written and compiles, and `invoke()` filters exactly as documented — but the **JS dev server** serialises the raw checkpoint and ignores `output`, so a live surface could only ever show the split failing. The route explains the mechanism and shows the measurement instead. See [§9 item 3](#9-known-issues--docvsimplementation-discrepancies).

**`/shared-state/workflow-execution`** — 📄 reference only, no demo. The page currently serves the Input/Output Schemas content verbatim, so it has no content of its own to implement.

## 8. Testing checklist / current status

Verified 2026-08-06 by driving every graph through the real `CopilotRuntime` route against a live `langgraph-cli dev` and an OpenAI key. All thirteen run without a `RUN_ERROR`; the ⚠️ rows are behavioural limitations, all measured.

| [shared-state/workflow-execution](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/workflow-execution) | `/shared-state/workflow-execution` | — | 📄 Reference | Upstream duplicate of the page above; nothing of its own to implement |

**Totals:** 7 ✅ Working · 2 ⚠️ Partial · 3 📄 Reference (Introduction, Input/Output Schemas, Workflow Execution) · 0 ❌ Broken.

The same table is rendered in-app at `/status`, generated from `frontend/src/lib/nav-config.ts` — that file is the single source of truth for routes, statuses and doc links, so this table and the app cannot drift apart.

---

## 9. Known issues / doc-vs-implementation discrepancies

Every item was checked against the installed packages; the behavioural ones were reproduced against a live run.

### TypeScript-specific — these do not affect the Python sibling

**1. The Quickstart's dependency list does not install.**
[quickstart](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/quickstart) says `npm install deepagents @langchain/langgraph @copilotkit/sdk-js @langchain/openai`. That fails with `ERESOLVE`: `deepagents@1.12.2` depends on `zod ^4.3.6`, while `@copilotkit/sdk-js@1.66.2` peer-requires `zod ^3.23.3 || ^3.24.0 || ^3.25.0` — v3 only. Fix used here: pin `zod@^3.25.76` at the root, which satisfies the peer range and lets npm give `deepagents` its own nested v4. The page also never mentions `langchain`, which its own snippets import `tool` and `createMiddleware` from.

**2. `exposeState` cannot see any user state field.**
The intended remedy for "the model doesn't see my state" — `createCopilotkitMiddleware({ exposeState })` — appends a "Current agent state:" note to the system prompt, built from `request.state` inside the CopilotKit middleware's own `wrapModelCall`. **That object is scoped to the declaring middleware's `stateSchema`**, so it contains only `messages` and `copilotkit`. Your `language` field lives on *your* middleware and is invisible to it. Verified with a spy middleware: the note is never appended, with `exposeState: ["language"]` *and* with `exposeState: true`. Since every user field is declared on a user middleware, `exposeState` has nothing it can reach. The Python `CopilotKitMiddleware(expose_state=[...])` reads whole graph state and works — same feature, opposite outcome.
→ `/shared-state/in-app-agent-write` is ⚠️ Partial as a result.

**3. The JS dev server ignores `output` schemas.**
`StateGraph({ state, input, output })` filters correctly when called directly:
```
await graph.invoke({...})            -> [ 'answer', 'messages' ]                        ✅
```
Through the dev server — with or without CopilotKit in the path — it does not:
```
POST /threads/{id}/runs/wait          -> [ 'answer', 'messages', 'question', 'resources' ]  ❌
GET  /threads/{id}/state              -> [ 'answer', 'messages', 'question', 'resources' ]  ❌
```
So the server serialises the raw checkpoint, and AG-UI's `STATE_SNAPSHOT` inherits every field. The Python server does filter: the same route there yields exactly `["messages", "copilotkit", "answer"]`.
→ `/shared-state/state-inputs-outputs` is 📄 reference-only as a result: the graph is real, but there is nothing it can demonstrate live.

**4. `zodState` is mandatory and two pages omit it.**
Its docstring explains why: without it a Zod field carries no JSON-schema hook, LangGraph drops it from the graph's `output_schema`, and AG-UI filters it out of every `STATE_SNAPSHOT` — so `useAgent().state.x` stays `undefined` even though the thread state has the value. Both shared-state pages use it correctly. [interrupt-based](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/generative-ui/your-components/interrupt-based) declares `agentName: z.string().optional()` bare, and [frontend-tools](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/frontend-tools) does the same for `yourAdditionalProperty`. Neither route reads those fields in the browser so nothing breaks — but copy either as a template for a field you *do* want to read and it silently never arrives.

### Shared with the Python sibling

**5. Predictions need `<CopilotKit>`, not `<CopilotKitProvider>`.**
Not stated on any page, and the worst failure mode here because it is completely silent. The backend emits a `PredictState` custom event; the *browser* applies it by watching `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` and calling `agent.setState`. Nothing appears in any `STATE_SNAPSHOT`. That subscriber lives in `CopilotListeners`, which `<CopilotKit>` mounts and `<CopilotKitProvider>` does not. With the bare provider the event arrives, nobody listens, the panel stays empty, and no error is logged.

**6. `enabled` has no `eventValue`, and `event.value` is a string.**
[interrupt-based](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/generative-ui/your-components/interrupt-based)'s "Condition UI executions" section writes `enabled: ({ eventValue }) => …`. The parameter is typed `InterruptEvent<TValue>` — `{ name, value }` — so this is a hard `TS2339` compile error in TypeScript (the Python repo only finds it at runtime). Separately, a LangGraph `interrupt()` reaches the browser as the legacy `on_interrupt` custom event with its value **serialised**, so `event.value.type` is `undefined` on a string. **Both are left in the demo unedited**, with a `@ts-expect-error` on each `enabled` line so the repo still builds — and those annotations are the evidence rather than a patch, since an unused one is itself an error (`TS2578`). The page's *first* section is fine.

**7. `useDefaultRenderTool` render props have no `args`.**
[tool-rendering](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/generative-ui/tool-rendering) destructures `{ name, args, status, result }`. The prop is `parameters` — as it is in the page's own `useRenderTool` snippet directly above. Reading `args` returns `undefined`, silently.

**8. `useRenderToolCall` is not the hook the prose means.**
Named three times as the counterpart to `useDefaultRenderTool`. It is a real export but a different hook — no arguments, returns a function that renders a given tool call from renderers already registered. The one meant is `useRenderTool`.

**9. `state-rendering` never calls its own emit loop.**
It prints `chatNode` and stops, saying only that it belongs "inside a custom graph node function". A `tool()` is the one place a prebuilt Deep Agent gets a `RunnableConfig`, so that is where it went. Two further unmentioned things: emitted state is a *prediction* and is overwritten when the node returns, and a tool returning a `Command` must include its own `ToolMessage`.

**10. `workflow-execution` serves the wrong page.**
It returns [state-inputs-outputs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/state-inputs-outputs) byte for byte — same subtitle, prose, code. Only the `h1` differs, and even the subtitle describes the *other* page's topic. Marked 📄 reference rather than guessed at — there is no Workflow Execution content to implement until the page serves its own.

**11. The Quickstart installs a frontend package it never uses.**
`npm install @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/runtime`, but every import it then writes is from `@copilotkit/react-core/v2`. `@copilotkit/react-ui` is the v1 UI package; not installed here.

**12. Model ids vary across pages.**
`openai:gpt-4o`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-4o-mini` all appear. Every agent here reads `OPENAI_MODEL`, defaulting to `gpt-4o` — with one deliberate exception. `state_rendering_agent` pins `openai:gpt-5.4`, the id its own page prints, because the route depends on the model making a *second* tool call to mark its tasks done and `gpt-4o` consistently makes only the first. Measured on both.

**13. Neither shared-state page has anything that writes the field from the agent's side.**
[in-app-agent-read](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/in-app-agent-read) shows a `language` field and a panel that reflects it, and stops there. The Writing route has the browser's `agent.setState`; the Reading route has nothing at all, so "switch to Spanish" changed the prose and left the field on `english` — the panel the page exists to demonstrate never moved. A `set_language` tool returning a `Command` (plus its own `ToolMessage`, per item 9) is the glue added here.

**14. The prebuilt Predictive State Updates tool, as printed, cannot persist anything.**
[predictive-state-updates?agent-type=prebuilt](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/predictive-state-updates?agent-type=prebuilt) writes `tool(async (args) => args, …)`. `stateStreamingMiddleware` streams the `steps` argument into `observed_steps` while the model writes it, but that is a *prediction* scoped to the run: when the node returns, LangGraph writes the node's own update over it, and a tool returning its arguments contributes no `observed_steps`. Measured — the list filled during generation and was empty again by the time the reply finished. Returning a `Command` fixes it, which is the same correction both custom-graph variants on the same page already carry.

### Where the TypeScript tabs are *better* than the Python ones

Worth recording, since it is the reason this repo covers more than its sibling:

- **Both custom-graph variants of Predictive State Updates are printed in full** — annotation, node, wiring, `compile`. The Python tabs show a bare node referencing an undefined `cpk_action_node`, so the Python repo can only quote them. Two extra live routes here.
- **Variant 1's `createDeepAgent` actually lists its state middleware.** The Python tab defines `AgentState` and never references it, so the key does not exist.
- **Variant 3 wraps frontend actions in `convertActionsToDynamicStructuredTools`** before `bindTools`. The Python tab passes `state["copilotkit"]["actions"]` straight in, and nothing in the Python package does that conversion.
- **`createMiddleware` carries schema and hook together**, so the interrupt-based snippet is complete; the Python equivalent needs three pieces and prints two.
- **`zodState(z.enum([...]).default("english"))` really applies at runtime.** The Python `Literal[...] = "english"` on a `TypedDict` is a class attribute LangGraph never applies, so the Python repo has to seed the key by hand.

Two of the page's TypeScript snippets do not typecheck, and both are left as printed with a `@ts-expect-error` above them rather than edited — the annotation is the evidence, since an unused one is itself an error (`TS2578`):

- `Annotation<string[]>({ default: () => [] })` in the manual-emission variant. `TS2345`: the config requires a `value` reducer alongside `default`. **Runtime is unaffected** — LangGraph falls back to last-write-wins, and the four steps stream correctly. Type-only defect.
- `enabled: ({ eventValue }) => …` on the interrupt-based page (item 6 above). That one *does* break at runtime.

One genuine edit: `shouldContinue as any` in the tool-emission variant is replaced with a typed destination list on `addConditionalEdges`, which is the same thing expressed without the cast.

## 10. Troubleshooting

The Deep Agents doc tree has **no** Troubleshooting section as of 2026-08-06. What follows is this repo's own symptom list, from actually running it.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `npm install` in `backend/` fails with `ERESOLVE` / zod | `deepagents` wants zod v4, `@copilotkit/sdk-js` peers on v3. | Keep the pinned `zod@^3.25.76` in `package.json` — §9 item 1. |
| `Failed to create thread: HTTP 422: Invalid thread ID: must be a UUID` | Something posted a non-UUID `threadId`. | Use `crypto.randomUUID()`. |
| Chat shows an error banner; agent log is silent | The runtime cannot reach `:8124`. | Is the dev server running? `curl http://localhost:8124/ok`. Check `LANGGRAPH_DEPLOYMENT_URL`. |
| First message to a custom-graph route hangs ~30s, then answers | The dev server infers a hand-built `StateGraph`'s schema on the first `GET /assistants/{id}/schemas`, and the run POST waits on it. Deep Agents are unaffected — their state is already a Zod schema. | One-off per graph per server process. Warm it with `curl -s -o /dev/null http://localhost:8124/assistants/<graph_id>/schemas`. The recorder does this for every published graph at startup (`autorecorder/actions/warm-agent-schemas.ts`); without it the first recording of a cold graph fails at the 30s response budget looking like a dead backend. |
| Agent runs but every reply is an auth error | `OPENAI_API_KEY` missing. | It goes in **`backend/.env`**, not `frontend/.env.local`. |
| A route 500s with "Agent … not found" | Graph id mismatch. | `frontend/src/lib/agents.ts` must list the same ids as `backend/langgraph.json`. |
| Wrong language's agent answers | Both repos on one port. | This repo is 8124, the Python sibling 8123. Don't cross them. |
| Predictive State Updates panel never fills | Root provider is `<CopilotKitProvider>`. | Use `<CopilotKit>` — §9 item 5. Fails silently. |
| A custom state field never reaches `useAgent().state` | Missing `zodState` wrapper. | Wrap it — §9 item 4. |
| Shared-state toggle flips but the agent ignores it | Known limitation. | Not fixable from userland — §9 item 2. |
| Input/Output Schemas shows `question`/`resources` present | Known limitation. | The graph is right; the JS server leaks — §9 item 3. |
| `Expected ... ToolMessage` / unanswered tool call | A tool returned a `Command` without one. | Include a `ToolMessage` with the injected `tool_call_id` — see `stateRendering.ts`. |
| Unexpected `✓ write_todos` / `✓ ls` rows in chat | Not a bug — `createDeepAgent` installs planning and filesystem tools. | — |
| Graph edits don't take effect | The CLI watches files but a syntax error aborts the reload. | Check the server log. |

## Doc drift detection

`/doc-sync` keeps this repo honest about the docs it mirrors. Press **Sync docs now** (on the landing page or on `/doc-sync`) and it fetches the markdown source behind all 11 tracked doc pages, diffs each against the copy stored in `doc-snapshot/`, replaces that copy, and reports what moved — ranked by whether the change can actually break an implementation.

Doc pages are fetched by appending `.md` to their URL, which returns the authored MDX rather than 250 KB of rendered HTML. Every response is checked for `text/markdown` before it is allowed near the snapshot: a URL that misses the markdown handler still answers `200` with the HTML app shell, and writing that in would destroy the baseline and report the whole corpus as rewritten on the next run. A run commits all pages or none.

**Severity is decided by where the edit landed**, not how big it was:

| Level | Trigger |
|---|---|
| **High** | a changed line inside a fenced code block, a changed fence count, or a page that now 404s and is gone from the sitemap |
| **Medium** | a changed heading, changed frontmatter `title`/`description`, or prose in the same section as changed code |
| **Low** | other prose |

**Sections checked** lists every tracked page in nav order with a mark — `✓` unchanged, `!` changed, `+` stored, `✗` 404, `~` unstable, `·` not checked. Expanding a row shows the comparison: for a changed page the diff (`−` existing snapshot, `+` newly fetched), and for an unchanged one the two matching hashes, which is the evidence the check ran.

**`doc-snapshot/CHANGELOG.md`** is the record that survives a re-sync. Because syncing replaces the copy it just compared against, the run *after* a change reports nothing — so the changelog is written at the moment of discovery and never rewritten later. Only changed pages are recorded; a clean run does not touch the file. It keeps the three most recent dated entries, counted rather than aged, so a change from six weeks ago still shows if nothing has happened since.

**One sync date.** `syncedAt` in `doc-snapshot/manifest.json`, rewritten on every run and shown on `/`, `/status` and `/doc-sync`. There is no hand-maintained date to keep in step with it.

**To test it**, edit any `doc-snapshot/pages/*.md` file and press the button — a line inside a code fence for High, a `##` heading for Medium, a sentence for Low. The comparison reads the stored file itself, so nothing else needs changing. Both `/doc-sync` and the changelog label the result as a local snapshot edit rather than upstream drift.

Commit `doc-snapshot/` — `pages/`, `manifest.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` are the baseline every diff is taken against. `reports/` is gitignored derived data.

Every route's `page.tsx` renders its source with `<SourceCode file="…">`, which reads the file off disk on the server at render time. What a route shows is therefore always what actually runs.
