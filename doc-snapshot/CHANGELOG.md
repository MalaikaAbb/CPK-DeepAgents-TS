# Doc drift changelog

What the CopilotKit docs changed under this repo, written by the sync on
`/doc-sync`. Only pages that actually moved are recorded — a sync that finds
everything unchanged writes nothing here at all.

Holds the 3 most recent dated entries. When a change lands on a fourth
date, the oldest entry is dropped. Entries are counted, not aged, so a gap of
weeks between changes does not expire anything.
